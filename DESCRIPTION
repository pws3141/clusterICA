Description:
  An implementation of approximate Indepdendent Component Analysis, using
  clustering and optimisation of random projections of the data. It combines
  ordering of random points on the projective space and clustering of the best
  points using divisive k-means until some tolerance condition is met, with an
  optimisation step for each cluster. Each loading is found sequentially, and
  Householder rotations are used to make each loading orthogonal to all
  previous ones.
